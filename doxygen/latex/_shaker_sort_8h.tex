user-\/defined header to propagate declarations to code file. ~\newline
 

library that controls reading from and writing to the standard streams. ~\newline


A framework that relates a time point to real physical time. The library provides at least three clocks that provide means to express the current time. ~\newline


library that offers reliable and efficient functions for dynamic memory allocation, conversion between datatypes, pseudo-\/random number generation, process control, searching and sorting, math, and multibyte or wide characters. ~\newline


library which helps us in manipulating the output of the program. ~\newline


library that implements high-\/level input/output operations on file based streams. ~\newline


library that allows performing insertion, extraction, and other operations for parsing inputs and converting strings to numbers, and vice-\/versa. ~\newline
