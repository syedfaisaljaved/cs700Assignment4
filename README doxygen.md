## Getting Started
#### This assignment contains a program to input an array size from user then create a random array of that size and store the array to a file. Then read the array from the file and perform shaker sort (bi-directional bubble sort) in both ascending and descending order and calculate the execution time for both sort and display on the console and store the sorted arrays in each file.

### 1. Main file.
### Contents -
1. [Main CPP File](main.cpp)
### Usage -
